The **HEXED (Human-Centric eXplainable AI in Education) Workshop** will be held in conjunction with [EDM (Educational Data Mining) 2024](https://educationaldatamining.org/edm2024/). The workshop aims to bring together a specialized community of researchers who can work together to (1) develop a shared vision and common vocabulary for XAI in education, (2) share and disseminate work, (3) create robust methods for increasing interpretability, and (4) develop evaluation metrics for assessing explanations and model interpretability. We plan to achieve this through lively debate and discussion surrounding the current and future needs of the community.

The workshop will be held in July 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Remote participants are also welcome to attend.

Registration and submission details will be available soon. Stay tuned for more information!

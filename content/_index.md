The **HEXED (Human-Centric eXplainable AI in Education) Workshop** was held in conjunction with [EDM (Educational Data Mining) 2024](https://educationaldatamining.org/edm2024/). The workshop aimed to bring together a specialized community of researchers who can work together to (1) develop a shared vision and common vocabulary for XAI in education, (2) share and disseminate work, (3) create robust methods for increasing interpretability, and (4) develop evaluation metrics for assessing explanations and model interpretability. We planned to achieve this through lively debate and discussion surrounding the current and future needs of the community.

The workshop was held on **14 July 2024** in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. This is a full-day **hybrid** workshop and will feature a mix of poster presentations, a lively panel discussion, and interactive sessions to facilitate collaboration.

The **2nd Human-Centric eXplainable AI in Education (HEXED) Workshop** will be held in conjunction with [EDM (Educational Data Mining) 2025](https://educationaldatamining.org/edm2025/). The workshop aims to bring together a specialized community of researchers who can work together to (1) establish a shared vision and common vocabulary for XAI in education, (2) facilitate the exchange of recent research and best practices, (3) brainstorm practical methods to enhance model transparency that are specific to the education domain, and (4) define evaluation metrics for assessing explanations and interpretability with teachers, students, and parents. We plan to achieve this through lively debate and discussion surrounding the current and future needs of the community.

The workshop will be held on **20 July 2025** in Palermo, Italy. This is a full-day **hybrid** workshop and will feature a mix of poster presentations, a lively panel discussion, and interactive sessions to facilitate collaboration.

After the <b>HEXED</b> workshop, attendees interested in diving deeper into the pedagogical and regulatory implications of XAI might find it interesting to attend the half-day <b><a href="https://www.xai-ed.net/">XAI-Ed: Pedagogy-Founded Explainable AI for Transparent, User-Centered AI in Education</a></b> workshop which will take place on July 22nd at <a href="https://aied2025.itd.cnr.it/">AIED 2025 Conference</a>. AIED and EDM are jointly located this year in Palermo and the proceedings of both HEXED and XAI-Ed will be jointly disseminated.

## Themes

- The need for greater explainability in education.
- The case for intrinsic vs. post-hoc explainability.
- Ensuring explanation faithfulness.
- Designing evaluation metrics and methods for assessing explanations and/or models.
- Aligning explanations with teachers' and students' needs.
- Generating actionable explanations as a basis for classroom interventions and personalized learning.
- The role of LLMs in Explainable AI. 

## Call for papers

The **growing need for interpretable AI in education**, along with the increasing awareness of its challenges and implications, calls for a community of experts to work together to:

1. develop a shared vision and common vocabulary in trustworthy educational data mining,
2. disseminate work to raise awareness of the need for interpretable AI in education,
3. create robust methods for increasing interpretability,
4. develop evaluation metrics for assessing explanations and model interpretability, and
5. measure and integrate the perceptions of educational stakeholders (students, teachers, administrators, parents) into trustworthy AI pipelines.

All papers must be submitted by 24 May 2025 AoE (anywhere on Earth).

Submitted papers should be formatted using the [EDM submission templates available here](https://educationaldatamining.org/edm2025/instructions-for-authors/), and submitted to the EasyChair [HEXED Workshop on EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=hexed2025). Accepted papers will be invited to present at a poster session, and presenters may be invited to give spotlight talks. References do not count towards the page limit. Authors can also include appendices to more clearly describe datasets and tools if necessary, and these do not count toward the page limit.

# Submission templates

We request that you submit your paper as a PDF file on [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=hexed2025). To facilitate consistent formatting, please use our provided templates. An Overleaf project is available for LaTeX users [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fbbvhjxwjqyg#3ece8d). Simply make a copy of the project ("Menu" > "Copy Project"). Alternatively, you can download an offline version [here](https://hexed-workshop.github.io/HEXED2025_template.zip). This download also includes ODT (LibreOffice) and DOCX (Microsoft Word) template files.

Our templates follow the [CEUR-WS style](https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html#CEURART), with some settings already configured for you, including:

- Two-column format
- Headers and footers
- Conference title and hyperlink

Use of these templates is mandatory as it will facilitate the process of publication on CEUR-WS.
